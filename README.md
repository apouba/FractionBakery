# FractionBakery
Created by Abbey Pouba & Kerry O'Malley

After research and a few iterations, we have designed a full idea to teach 3rd grade fractions (See the Game Design PDF for full description).

We implemented the first level map including the first 3 levels. Abbey fully implemented the first level, and Kerry fully implemented the second and third levels. Co-development included the main map.
